# Log Team Meeting 2
07 October 2021

**_This file is unfinished._**
## Decisions
* ...

## Finished Tasks
* Enable pi's to access repository via Git
* Establish pi-to-pi SSH connection
* Corner detection on an image (displayed)

## Future Tasks
* Find and code method for pi-to-pi file transfer via Python
* Find and code method for concurrent pi-to-consumer device panorama transfer via Python
* From corner matching to making a transformation matrix
  
## Running Tasks (general)
* Inter-pi communication
* Pi-to-consumer device communication
* Corner detection and matching in between two images
